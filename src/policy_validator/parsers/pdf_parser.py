"""PDF document parser for policy validation.

This module provides functionality for extracting and analyzing content from
PDF documents using the PyPDF2 library. It handles text extraction and
metadata analysis for policy validation.

Example:
    parser = PdfParser("policy.pdf")
    content = parser.parse()
    text = content['text']
    metadata = content['metadata']
    structure = content['structure']

Note:
    Text extraction quality depends on PDF format:
    - Searchable PDFs provide best results
    - Scanned documents may require OCR (not implemented)
    - Password-protected PDFs cannot be processed
    - Complex layouts may affect text ordering
